# Email-header-analyzer
EMLAnalyzer is a command-line Java tool that analyzes .eml email files to identify potential security risks such as spoofing, phishing, and forged headers. It checks SPF, DKIM, and DMARC authentication, inspects email routing paths, and provides a simple verdict on whether the email is safe or suspicious.
